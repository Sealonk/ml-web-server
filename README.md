## Description

This project implements a Node.js-based machine learning web server that exposes APIs for performing model inference. It is designed for efficiency, scalability, and simplicity, making it easy to integrate ML models into web applications.

## Features

- RESTful API for ML model inference
- Modular structure for easy model integration
- Docker support for seamless deployment
- Scalable for production environments
- Logging and error handling for reliability

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js, Brain.js (or any other JavaScript-based ML library used in your project)
- **Others**: Docker, JSON for API communication

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-web-server.git

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API locally at:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

Example usage with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]}' http://127.0.0.1:3000/predict
```

## Docker (Optional)

To build and run the server using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t ml-web-server .
docker run -p 3000:3000 ml-web-server
```

## Endpoints

### POST /predict

- Description: Perform predictions using the ML model.
- Request Body:
  ```json
  {
  "input": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json
  {
  "prediction": [0.9, 0.1]
  }
  ```

### GET /health

- Description: Check the server's health.
- Response:
  ```json
  {
  "status": "OK"
  }
  ```
